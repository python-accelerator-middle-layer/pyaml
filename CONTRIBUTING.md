# Contributing to [Python Accelerator Middle Layer (PyAML)]

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [PyAML]! This document outlines how you can help, whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or participating in community discussions.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- **Bugs & Feature Requests:** Open an issue on GitHub. Use clear titles and provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, expected/actual behaviour, screenshots, etc.).
- Use an issue template if it is applicable to you. Don't forget to assign an issue to a project and set the status of the issue to TODO.
- **Before Submitting:** Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

### 2. Working on Tasks
- **Kanban Board:** We use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/python-accelerator-middle-layer/projects) to manage tasks. Each column represents a stage in the workflow (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done").
- **Claiming a Task:** Comment and assign yourself on the issue or card to let others know you’re working on it. Move the card to "In Progress".
- **Part-time Contributors:** It’s okay to work at your own pace. Just keep the community updated on your progress.

### 3. Submitting Changes
- **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repo and create a branch for your changes.
- **Commits:** Write clear, atomic commit messages. Reference the issue number if applicable.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
  - Open a PR against the `main` branch.
  - Include a description of your changes and reference the relevant issue.
  - Ensure your code follows the project’s style and passes all tests.

### 4. Documentation
