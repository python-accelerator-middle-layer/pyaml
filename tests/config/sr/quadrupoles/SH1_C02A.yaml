name: SH1-C02A         #Name of the element in the lattice model
mapping:
  # Multipole mapping for usage in families, in this example SH1-C01A-H is not 
  # a lattice element present in the model, it is just a name to use in 
  # PyAML families. When this 'virutal' element is set, it then applies
  # the corresponding multipole on the parent element.
