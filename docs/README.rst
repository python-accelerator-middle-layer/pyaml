Documentation tools
===================

The documentation is compiled with
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_.

For a local check when writing documentation, Sphinx and the
necessary extensions are automatically installed if you install pyAML with
the [doc] option::

    $ pip install -e ".[doc]"

When committing the changes it's a good idea to also run the pre-commit.
This can be installed by following the instructions for [developer installation](https://pyaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#developer-installation).

Then, the compilation may be triggered from the ``docs`` directory with::

    $ cd pyaml/docs
    $ make html

Since the `.rse` files generated by autosummary are kept in version control they are not automatically regenerated from scratch.
If you want to do that to make sure they are up-to-date you need to first delete the folder `api` before doing `make html`.
