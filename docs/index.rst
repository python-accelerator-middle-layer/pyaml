pyAML documentation
===================

Introduction
------------

python Accelerator Middle Layer (pyAML) is a joint technology platform to develop common tools for control, tuning and development of storage rings, beam transport lines and linear accelerators.

With pyAML, it WILL be possible to (the software is at conceptualization stage):

- **get/set instruments attributes**: such as strengths of magnets and positions from BPMS
- **use the same tuning tools in any facility using pyAML**,
- **compare data to it's digital twin equivalent**,
- **compute statistical properties for several lattice instances with errors**
- **flexible complex unit conversions**
- **easy and friendly configuration**
- many more features
