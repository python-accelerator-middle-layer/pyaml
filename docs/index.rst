Python Accelerator Middle Layer
===================

Python Accelerator Middle Layer (pyAML) is a joint technology platform for design, commissioning and operation of particle accelerators.

The code is still under development. The features include among others:

- A control system agnostic interface to interact with the accelerator.
- Same interface to different backends: live accelerator, virtual accelerator and simulator.
- Machine independence allowing configuration of different type of accelerators and facility specific naming conventions.
- Unit conversions.
- Automatic generation of metadata and standardized format for measurement data.
- A set of standard applications and a framework for developing new applications.
